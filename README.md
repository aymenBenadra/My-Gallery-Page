## Overview

![screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)

This was a tricky project as I didn't create a card myself before using pure html and Scss, I usually used Bootstrap or other libraries for that but I made it to the end using only Html and SCSS to further learn about the fondamentals behind the scenes.

I used Flexbox for positioning the elements on the Header (which is the Card) and CSS Grid to structure the Gallery.

### Built With
